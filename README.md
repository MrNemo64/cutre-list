# CutreList

CutreList is a project I developed during my degree, consisting of an Express server and a Vue.js client. The goal was to deepen my understanding of OpenAPI, REST APIs, and building SPAs.

The core functionality of the project is a simple CRUD TODO app. You can find a detailed description of the features in the [OLD_README.md](https://github.com/MrNemo64/cutre-list/blob/main/OLD_README.md). While most of the functionality revolves around standard CRUD operations with pagination, there is one feature Iâ€™m particularly proud of.

One of my goals was to allow the same user to maintain multiple active sessions simultaneously. For example, if a user had two browser tabs open on the tasks view and edited a task in one tab, the changes would automatically reflect in the other tab. To achieve this, I implemented Server-Sent Events, which I learned and integrated on my own.

While SSE may seem unnecessary for a simple TODO app, this implementation paves the way for more advanced features, such as task sharing between users, with all participants seeing updates in real-time.

You can find further details about this feature, along with GIFs showing how it works, at the end of the [OLD_README.md](https://github.com/MrNemo64/cutre-list/blob/main/OLD_README.md#SSE).

## Deploying

There is a docker compose provided that exposes the API to the localhost on port 3000 and the Vue.js client on port 5173.
